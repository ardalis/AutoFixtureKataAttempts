# AutoFixture Kata Attempts

My own working through the [AutoFixtureKata](https://github.com/ardalis/AutoFixtureKataStarter). Go there to get the instructions.

Look for the START tag in this repo if you're looking for a good starting point that's ready to go. Otherwise, follow the instructions and do the other 2 katas first.
